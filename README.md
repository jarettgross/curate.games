# Trove.games

## The Idea
A website for showcasing one game every few (3?) days. Usually unknown, smaller indie games, with maybe some more popular ones thrown in there.
Information to be displayed (check the images):
- Title
- Platforms
- How Long to Beat
- Metacritic (average score)
- Replay Value
- Difficulty
- Price + Purchase Link
- Game Image
- Video

A blurb and mini review, to give our thoughts on the game as well as a nice, quick overview. Something like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/6ofohv/eshop_coverage_72017_ive_played_em/?st=j5exou8i&sh=2cf31268). A combination of the "overview", "TL;DR", and "Buy?" -- need to think this through a bit more.

## Tools and Technologies
- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
- [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)
- [Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)
- Javascript

## Style Guide
Use spaces (four), not tabs (or replace tabs with spaces before committing). Pushing with tabs causes weird spacing.
Organize main.scss with comments (check out flexbox.scss)

## Miscellaneous
- Start your Jekyll server with "jekyll serve" and access it through localhost:4000
- Anything in \_site is generated by Jekyll -- don't edit those (they'll just be changed back anyway)
- \_posts is where our new posts will go. They have a specific naming format: yyyy-mm-dd-title.markdown
- \_sass is where scss files that we want to import into main.scss will go
- The css/ folder is for main.scss and any other files we'd need (we should only need the one)
- \_config.yml is for site-wide configuration. It's a little confusing, so I recommend reading a little (YAML)
- index.html is our home (and only, besides 404) html file. Need to figure out how to have it display the most recent posts
- Read up on Liquid, the templating language used with Jekyll
