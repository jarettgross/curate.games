## The Idea
A website for showcasing one game every few days. Usually unknown, smaller indie games, with maybe some more popular ones thrown in there.

A blurb and mini review, to give our thoughts on the game as well as a nice, quick overview. Something like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/6ofohv/eshop_coverage_72017_ive_played_em/?st=j5exou8i&sh=2cf31268). A combination of the "overview", "TL;DR", and "Buy?" -- need to think this through a bit more.
