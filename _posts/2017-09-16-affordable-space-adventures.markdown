blurb: An immersive, 2D puzzle-adventure game that makes brilliant use of the Wii U's GamePad.

    <span class="review-header">Overview</span>
    Affordable Space Adventures has the player (or players) control a tiny spaceship, navigating around atmospheric 2D levels and solving puzzles. This is done with a brilliant use of the Wii U's GamePad, having the player control different aspects of the ship, such as thrust, mass, and gravity, which in turn cause the ship to change its heat, electricity, and sound outputs. If these output levels are too high or too low, then the ship is in trouble. Along with the quiet, ominous aesthetic, the game has a minimal, yet intriguing, story that will keep you interested and immersed.

    <span class="review-header">Gameplay</span>
    Each level in Affordable Space Adventures has you use different controls of your ship in order to make your way through the level. Sometimes you'll need to turn your thrust all the way up to speed through an area, all while carefully watching your heat meter to make sure your ship doesn't overheat. Other times you need to switch to an electricity engine so that you can control the ship's antigravity. All of these options are managed through the GamePad, having different touch-buttons for each control and gauges for each system of your ship. The game is a well-balanced mix of moving your ship with the control stick, watching for potential dangers, and changing your ship's controls, managing the gauges. The levels build upon each other, and ship controls become available as you progress. This leads to more complicated and satisfying puzzles, with a nice, gradual difficulty increase.

    <span class="review-header">Other Features</span>
    With the use of the GamePad, Affordable Space Adventures makes it so that up to three player can control the ship, with each player controlling different aspects. These can lead to some cooperative fun when trying to solve difficult puzzles.

    <span class="review-header">Is it for you?</span>
    Affordable Space Adventures does a great job of making it stand out from other 2D puzzle-adventure games, and the puzzles are creatively crafted, with each one making you think in new ways. If you're interested in these types of 2D puzzle games, then you'll have a great time with this one. The game's atmosphere and design gives you a deep sense of immersion, and it will immediately hook you in. Although only a few hours in length, you'll feel like you got your money's worth for this game.
