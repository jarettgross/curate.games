blurb: A uniquely-controlled, fun, and difficult roguelike. If you can get used to the controls, you'll want to keep coming back.

    <span class="review-header">Overview</span>
    On the surface, Tumbleseed is what you'd expect from a modern roguelike -- run-based, power-ups, money, and procedural map generation. It differs in its controls, which consists of the player moving a ball on a stick to avoid enemies and holes in the ground. The goal is to make it through each of the four major biomes, up to the top of a mountain. A score is tracked during your run, which indicates how high up the mountain you got.

    <span class="review-header">Gameplay</span>
    The unique controls and the procedurally-generated maps are the main draw of the game. Each run, which can last anywhere from 5 minutes to around 40 minutes, is different, which gives the game a lot of replayability. The controls will take some getting used to and are what makes the game so difficult. It is easy to lose control of your character if you're trying to get out of danger, and this can lead you to running into enemies or falling into holes. If you're able to adapt to the controls, which can take you a couple hours or more, there's a good chance you'll get hooked, wanting to place "one more run".

    <span class="review-header">Other Features</span>
    A mode to practice each of the biomes separately, where the maps are always the same. This will give you helpful experience for the adventure mode, where each map is randomly generated.
    <br>
    A daily map, which is a new randomly generated map each day, where you try to get the highest score possible to beat other players on the leaderboard.
    <br>
    A weekly map, which is a new randomly generated map each week.
    <br>
    Exclusive to the Nintendo Switch, there is a 2-player (local only) battle mode, where players try to accumulate 100 points by keeping their character in a designated zone on the map. This is a fun twist on the main gameplay, as players can utilize the power-ups to kill their opponent to force them to respawn outside the designated zone.

    <span class="review-header">Is it for you?</span>
    The game looks great, has a high polish to it, and is just $15. The decision to buy this game strongly depends on if you can master the controls as this is what really allows you to enjoy the game. Secondarily, if you like modern roguelikes, then this game has everything you'd expect, and you'll feel right at home.
