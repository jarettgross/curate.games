blurb: An underwater shoot 'em up with a one-of-a-kind art-style.
review: |
    <span class="review-header">Overview</span>
    Earth Atlantis is a side-scrolling shoot 'em up, where you control a submarine and fire bullets to take out enemies and obtain upgrades. As opposed to the regular games of this genre, in Earth Atlantis you navigate around a maze-like map to reach your objectives. This requires you to constantly backtrack through the map, searching for newly opened passages and accessing different areas. Your primary goal in Earth Atlantis is to take out the 38 "large monsters", which are various bosses with different attack and movement patterns. Each boss has its own design in the game's unique and beautiful "old sketching" art-style.

    <span class="review-header">Gameplay</span>
    The gameplay of Earth Atlantis is relatively simple -- shoot bullets to take out enemies, collect upgrades for your submarine, and turn your ship around. The ability to turn around your ship is a nice addition to game, adding a slight twist to the genre. This lets you shoot in the opposite direction and more easily navigate around the map. As you progress, enemies will grow in difficulty and you'll constantly come across bosses. You can check the map for where these bosses are, but it's up to you to figure out how to get there. Bosses are essentially very large enemies with a high amount of health and heavy damage-dealing attacks. They require well-timed dodging and, some of them, a good number of retries. To help fight these bosses, you want to collect powerups. One type of powerup upgrades your basic shots, adding more bullets per shot, which you can get by killing enemies. The second type of upgrade gives you a sort of special attack, such as homing missiles or bombs, and these you can collect from hidden crates or by killing bosses.

    There are three difficulty levels to choose from, letting you decide how challenging you want the game to be. Bosses can one-shot you on Normal difficulty and sometimes you'll be faced with a barrage of enemies, so we recommend trying Easy first.

    After beating the game (defeating all of the bosses), you can play in Hunter Mode, which is a "boss rush"-like mode, where you fight against as many bosses as you can in ten minutes, with each boss kill giving you more time.
    <br><br>
    You can unlock up to three other ships, each with different stats (damage, speed, bullet direction).

    <span class="review-header">Is it for you?</span>
    Earth Atlantis is a solid shoot 'em up, delivering mostly what you would expect from the genre. The art-style may not be for everyone, but every aspect of it looks great. The game is quite difficult, even on Normal mode, and will require some patience and dedication to work your way through each of the bosses. Each time you die, you'll need to recollect upgrades, working your way back to a more powerful submarine. While this doesn't take more than a couple of minutes, it can get tiresome if you keep dying to the same boss. The maze-like map is a neat addition and makes you explore each nook and cranny of the map if you want to find the next boss. This is good for getting you to upgrade your ship and find some hidden crates for the stronger powerups, but be prepared to get lost of a few times. Overall, Earth Atlantis is an enjoyable game with a one-of-a-kind art-style, and if you don't mind backtracking, then this is one of the more stand-out shoot 'em ups.
