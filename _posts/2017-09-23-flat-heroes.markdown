blurb: A fast-paced, intense platformer with minimalistic art, fun ideas, and enjoyable local multiplayer.
review: |
    <span class="review-header">Overview</span>
    Flat Heroes has the player partake in an intense platformer, constantly dodging waves of "enemies" (lines, arrows, and circles) to finish the level. The player controls an agile square, smoothly moving around the level, clinging to walls, and emitting small bursts to kill enemies. At the surface, it's a platformer, but dig a little deeper and it becomes more unique, with cool enemies and fun level design. The clean, minimalistic art-style of the game works well and goes great with the small sound effects that seem to fit perfectly with the aesthetic.

    <span class="review-header">Gameplay</span>
    The controls are what you would expect from a platformer -- move your character and jump. The movement feels smooth and allows for precise platforming, letting you do what you need in order to beat the level. You can cling to walls by holding a direction towards a wall and you can jump at varying heights depending on how long you hold down the button. You can also emit a small burst every few seconds to destroy nearby enemies. The enemies will spawn in waves and get progressively more difficult as you advance through the game. There are tiny bombs which will chase you, lines which will slice you, and more. There are many enemy varieties which prevents the gameplay from getting stale, along with smart level design which keeps throwing new ideas at you.

    <span class="review-header">Other Features</span>
    Flat Heroes can support up to four players in any of its modes -- campaign, survival, and versus. Working together through the campaign levels makes for a good challenge as you try not to bump into the other players.
    Survival mode has the players survive as long as possible through waves of enemies. This mode has different level types for different challenges and it's fun to try and beat your high scores.
    With versus mode, you can play against your friends in varying styles, such as battle. In this mode, players try to destroy each other's squares to rack up points, and it's just as intense as the main game.

    <span class="review-header">Is it for you?</span>
    With about one-hundred levels to beat and a few bosses mixed in for the campaign, Flat Heroes never runs out of ideas. The levels are engaging, and although they can get difficult and a bit frustrating later on, you'll want to keep trying again. If you have friends to play with, then it makes for a great co-op (or competitive) game. The additional modes will keep you coming back for more, whether it's to beat your high score or beat your friends. The game is still in Early Access, but already has a good amount of content, with more to come in the future. If you enjoy platformers, especially ones with tight controls, then you'll love Flat Heroes.
